# Scraping
My first scraping of a real world website

Required:
Step 1: Install Anaconda. Download it from https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-5.3.1-Windows-x86_64.exe for 64 bit and from https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-5.3.1-Windows-x86.exe for 32 bit OS.
Step 2: Install BeautifulSoup4 for parsing HTML elements. Install it by using pip install beautifulsoup4
Step 3: Run the notebook on Jupyter Notebook from the Anaconda Navigator.
